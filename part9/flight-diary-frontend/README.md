# Full Stack Open 2024 - Part 9: Flight Diary Frontend

All course materials for "Patientor Backend" exercises **9.17.–9.20.** are located inside the `flight-diary-frontend` folder.

## ✅ Exercises Overview

This section summarizes each implemented feature or requirement from the course:

### 9.17

- Connected to backend at `/api/diaries`
- Defined strict types for `DiaryEntry`
- Rendered each diary with `date`, `visibility`, and `weather`
- Ignored the `comment` field, as it wasn't returned by the API
- Added `diaryService.getAll()` to handle fetch logic

### 9.18

- Created `DiaryForm.tsx` with uncontrolled inputs
- Form submits data to backend using `diaryService.create()`
- App state updates on successful entry

### 9.19

- Used `try/catch` in `handleSubmit`
- Axios errors typed with `AxiosError`
- Displayed error message using a `Notification` component

### 9.20

- Switched `date` input to `<input type="date" />`
- Changed `weather` and `visibility` inputs to radio buttons
- Form state strongly typed and validated locally before submit

## 📦 Type Definitions

```ts
export enum Weather {
  Sunny = 'sunny',
  Rainy = 'rainy',
  Cloudy = 'cloudy',
  Stormy = 'stormy',
  Windy = 'windy'
}

export enum Visibility {
  Great = 'great',
  Good = 'good',
  Ok = 'ok',
  Poor = 'poor'
}

export interface DiaryEntry {
  id: number;
  date: string;
  weather: Weather;
  visibility: Visibility;
  comment?: string;
}

export type NewDiaryEntry = Omit<DiaryEntry, 'id'>;
```
